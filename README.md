# Password Generator 
Version 1.0.0

# Description
A password is randomly generated based on criteria that the user provides when prompted.

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first promoted for password length. The program then prompts the user to define if they would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letter, numbers and characters.

When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.
